# The Stack

## a group of simple operations that strengthen my skill development

The stack can be thought of as a game with simple rules and few operations. An ever-changing group of reading materials is used as pieces and the field of action.

                     |                                   |
      addition       |                                   |
          ------------------>                            |
                     |                                   |
                     |                                   |
                     |             attention             |
                     |                                   |
      subtraction    |                                   |
          <------------------                            |
                     |                                   |
                     |                                   |

The stack is a collection of materials that represent a variety of interests and projects. The stack focuses my attention, helps me start to make connections between disparate topics, and helps me generate ideas for projects.

TODO:

* fuller project description
* rules and criteria to define the operations
* discussion of the limitations of a mechanical process
* what kind of goals is the pile going to serve?
